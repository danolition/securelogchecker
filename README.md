# securelogchecker
A very simple python scripts that can read your secure log (/var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log) and is going to display any invalid login attempts to you. That can be valuable information which you can use to close certain ports or to block login attempts from certain ip ranges (can be done on the server if you run it locally or via your cloud provider's security settings)
